# Water Rendering

I have provided a makefile to use for compilation.
Make sure you have GLFW, GLM, and OpenGL on your computer.

Then run `make water` to compile or `make run` to compile and run in one step.

## What I did
I created the shaders as described. This was very difficult but I learned a lot about debugging in OpenGL. The fact that it doesn't ever tell you that something broke got me the first couple days I worked on this but eventually I got the hang of it.

I don't think I've ever understood VBO's, VAO's, buffers, and their interactions quite as well as I do right now.

## Controls
Move around with mouse and zoom in/out with up/down arrow keys.

## Bugs
None that I know of. I have only tested this on Ubuntu Linux (WSL).
